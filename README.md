## Why Server Side Rendering (L3)
- Browser requests page => Browser requests JS file => Content Visible
- Browser requests page => Browser requests JS file => React app boots, requests json => Content Visible
- loading the page as soon as possible
- server side rendering is designed to content rendered for the user as soon as possible

# Let's Get Coding

## App Overview (L5)
- very basic app => not much functionality

## Server Architecture Approach (L6)
- we are running two separate servers
- API Server => already built for us
- Rendering Server => **this is what we make**
- Why two back-end servers?
- We are de-coupling the business logic and data layer from the view layer
	+ Business Logic & Data Layer
		* db access
		* validation
		* authentication
		* authorization
		* logging
	+ View Layer
		* take data
		* produce HTML
- server side rendering is slow and performance is a big concern
